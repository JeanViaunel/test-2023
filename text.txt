Hello,
My name is Victor. I am using Linode to practice my Linux and ubuntu Slkills.

So far, I have reviewed not only my terminal command skills.my Linux skills,
but my SQL's as well.

I want to thank my gf who has been by my side every step of the way. She 
is the rock on which i rest, when things get rough. Thx Networkchuck, 
Angela, and linode's team.
